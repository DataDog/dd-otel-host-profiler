# Running the profiler directly on the host

## Prerequisites

The datadog-agent must be running on the host and configured to collect APM data (this is enabled by default in the agent, unless you explicitly disabled it). See agent installation instructions [here](https://docs.datadoghq.com/agent/) and the flag to enable APM [here](https://github.com/DataDog/datadog-agent/blob/8a80bcd1c1460ba9caa97d974568bd9d0c702f3f/pkg/config/config_template.yaml#L1036-L1042).

For the purposes of this guide, we assume that the datadog agent is accessible at a specific address from the docker container: `http://localhost:8126`.

## Installation

Download pre-built amd64 and arm64 binaries for our [latest release](https://github.com/DataDog/dd-otel-host-profiler/releases/latest).

Alternatively, you can build the profiler from source. The following instructions assume you have docker installed.

To build the profiler, you can use the following commands:

```
make profiler-in-docker
```

This will create a `dd-otel-host-profiler` binary in the current directory.

## Running the profiler

To run the profiler, you need to make sure that debugfs is mounted. If it's not, you can run:

```
sudo mount -t debugfs none /sys/kernel/debug
```

After that, you can start the profiler as shown below (make sure you run it as root):

```
sudo DD_SERVICE="dd-otel-host-profiler" dd-otel-host-profiler --agent-url "http://localhost:8126"
```

If your Datadog agent is reachable under a different address, you can modify the `--agent-url` parameter accordingly.

To enable the profiler to upload debug symbols when they're available locally (required to have function names for compiled languages like C/C++/Rust/Go/...), you must configure:
- The `DD_SITE` environment variable to [your Datadog site](https://docs.datadoghq.com/getting_started/site/#access-the-datadog-site) (e.g. `datadoghq.com`, `datadoghq.eu`, `us5.datadoghq.com`, ...).
- The `DD_API_KEY` environment variable to your Datadog API key.
- The `DD_APP_KEY` environment variable to your Datadog APP key. The APP key needs the `continuous_profiler_read` permission, which is available by default for the Datadog Read Only role (see [here](https://docs.datadoghq.com/account_management/rbac/permissions/#apm) for more information).
